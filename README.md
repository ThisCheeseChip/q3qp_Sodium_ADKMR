The Greatest Turn-Based Strategy Game Known To Man

To choose between heads or tails, select from the dropdown menu and click the toss coin button.  Click "FLIP" to see who gets in for the first punch. If luck is on your side, the "defend" button will be disabled and you'll have an advantage playing first. If not, your rival will take the lead. 

However, if you don't like the odds that you face, you can always renew your fate by pressing the "RESET" button. This button basically lets you redo the heads or tails.

Throughout the game, pay close attention to your HEALTH, which is clearly shown on the screen. Each player has a health score of 100 at the beginning. Attacks from your opponent have a 1â€“5 point damage range. You will have to choose between defending yourself and operating on the offensive.

When one player's health drops to zero, the game is over. To start over if you're wanting for another game, just click the "FULL RESET" button.
